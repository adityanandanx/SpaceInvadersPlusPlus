Build Instructions:-
1) First, you need to get ORX from the above mentioned website and install it ofcourse.
2) If you have Linux, then you need to have any one of the ide(s) as the folder name suggests in `build/linux/` OR you can just run `make --help` in the `build/linux/gmake` directory to get the available commands to build `release`, `profile`, or `debug` 
3) if you have windows, then, you need to create a new orx project with name `SpaceInvader` and replace this `build` folder with the `build` folder generated by you. and then build using VS or anything.
4) after you have successfully built the project, you can just head over to `bin/` and execute the corresponding file.
